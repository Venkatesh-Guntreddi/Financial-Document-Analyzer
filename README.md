# üìä Financial Document Analyzer

## ü§î Overview

The Financial Document Analyzer is an AI-powered application designed to streamline the process of understanding and extracting key information from various financial documents. Leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), it provides executive summaries, extracts Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and answers specific questions from uploaded financial reports.

## ‚ú® Features

  * **Multi-Format Document Support:** Processes financial data from a variety of file types including PDF, DOCX, TXT, XLSX (Excel), and various image formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG, TIFF, BMP) via OCR.
  * **Intelligent Text Extraction:** Utilizes `pdfplumber`, `python-docx`, `pandas`, and `EasyOCR` to accurately extract text from both native and scanned documents.
  * **AI-Powered Executive Summaries:** Generates concise and insightful executive summaries of financial health, key figures, profitability, and liquidity, powered by Groq's Llama 3 LLM.
  * **Key Performance Indicator (KPI) & Ratio Extraction:** Automatically identifies and extracts critical financial KPIs and common ratios from the document text.
  * **Interactive Q\&A with RAG:** Enables users to ask specific questions about the document's content and receive accurate, grounded answers directly from the source material using a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with FAISS vector store.
  * **Downloadable PDF Report:** Generates a professional PDF report summarizing the AI's findings (summary, KPIs, and ratios) for easy sharing or record-keeping.
  * **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Gradio for an intuitive web-based interface that allows easy file uploads and interaction.
  * **Robust Error Handling & Live Feedback:** Provides clear error messages and real-time processing updates to the user.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (High-Level Architecture)

The application follows a multi-step pipeline:

1.  **File Upload & Text Extraction:**
      * User uploads a financial document (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, Image, TXT).
      * The `extract_text.py` utility intelligently extracts text, using OCR (EasyOCR) for image-based content or scanned PDFs.
2.  **Data Processing & Indexing:**
      * The extracted text is sent to `summarize.py` for executive summary generation.
      * `parse_kpis.py` extracts structured KPIs and financial ratios.
      * For the Q\&A feature, the text is chunked (`RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`), embedded (`HuggingFaceEmbeddings`), and stored in a FAISS vector store (`qa_agent.py`).
3.  **AI Interaction (RAG & LLMs):**
      * **Summarization:** A Groq LLM (Llama 3 70B) generates a summary based on the entire extracted text, guided by a specialized prompt.
      * **Q\&A (RAG):** When a user asks a question, the `qa_agent.py` retrieves the most relevant text chunks from the FAISS vector store. These retrieved chunks, along with the user's question, are then provided as context to another Groq LLM (Llama 3 8B), ensuring the answer is accurate and grounded in the document.
4.  **Reporting & Output:**
      * Results (summary, KPIs, Q\&A answers) are displayed in the Gradio UI.
      * A consolidated PDF report is generated by `pdf_report.py`.

## üíª Technologies Used

  * **Python 3.8+**
  * **Gradio:** For the interactive web UI.
  * **LangChain:** For building LLM applications (Chains, RAG, Embeddings, Document Loaders, Text Splitters).
  * **Groq API:** For high-speed inference with Llama 3 LLMs.
  * **FAISS:** For efficient similarity search (vector store).
  * **HuggingFace Embeddings (sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2):** For creating text embeddings.
  * **EasyOCR:** For Optical Character Recognition from images and scanned PDFs.
  * **pdfplumber:** For text extraction from native PDFs.
  * **python-docx:** For text extraction from Word documents.
  * **pandas:** For handling and extracting data from Excel files.
  * **openpyxl:** Dependency for pandas to read XLSX.
  * **reportlab:** For generating custom PDF reports.
  * **fuzzywuzzy** & **python-Levenshtein:** For fuzzy string matching in KPI extraction.
  * **python-dotenv:** For managing environment variables.

## üöÄ Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to get your project up and running locally:

### 1\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Venkatesh-Guntreddi/financial-document-analyzer.git
cd financial-document-analyzer
```

*(If you created the repository with a different name on GitHub, please adjust `financial-document-analyzer` accordingly.)*

### 2\. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
# venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
```

### 3\. Install Dependencies

Install all the required Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4\. Set Up Environment Variables

You need an API key from [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys) to use their LLMs.

1.  Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your project (the same directory as `app.py`).
2.  Add your Groq API key to this file:
    ```
    GROQ_API_KEY='your_groq_api_key_here'
    ```
    Replace `'your_groq_api_key_here'` with your actual API key.

### 5\. Run the Application

Once all dependencies are installed and your `.env` file is set up, you can run the Gradio application:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will start, and you'll see a local URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:7860`) in your terminal. Open this URL in your web browser to access the UI.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Usage

1.  **Upload File:** On the "Upload & Summary" tab, click the "Upload Financial File" button to select your document.
2.  **Submit:** Click "üöÄ Submit". The application will process the file, displaying progress messages.
3.  **View Summary & KPIs:** Once processed, the executive summary and extracted KPIs/Ratios will appear on the same tab. A "Download AI Report" PDF button will also become visible.
4.  **Ask Questions:** Switch to the "üí¨ Ask a Question" tab. Type your question related to the uploaded document (e.g., "What was the net profit in 2023?", "Summarize the company's liabilities.") and click "üîç Get Answer". The answer will appear below.
5.  **Reset:** Use the "üîÑ Reset" button on either tab to clear all data and upload a new file.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements (Ideas for further development)

  * **Advanced Chunking Strategies:** Implement more sophisticated, semantically aware chunking for better context retrieval in RAG.
  * **Multi-Document Analysis:** Allow processing and querying across multiple uploaded financial documents simultaneously.
  * **Trend Analysis:** Incorporate functionality to compare financial metrics across different reporting periods or companies.
  * **Interactive Data Visualization:** Display KPIs and ratios using charts and graphs within the Gradio interface.
  * **Customizable Summaries:** Allow users to specify the length or focus of the summary.
  * **Integration with Financial APIs:** Connect to live financial data sources for real-time information or stock performance.
  * **Deployment:** Deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure, Hugging Face Spaces) for wider accessibility.
